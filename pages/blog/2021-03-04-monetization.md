# Monetization of Samerion

As a person who relies almost entirely on open-source software, I really, really don't want to force people to pay for
Samerion. However, since it's a very important project for me, something I have already spent so much time on and I'm
going to spend even more, I need it to give something back. And I need to cover potential server costs.

## Price of the game itself

The primary platform the game is targeting is desktop, particularly Linux and Windows, and possibly BSDs and Haiku if
possible. The game will most likely be available for download on [Steam] and it will be paid. I'm planning a low price
however, ranging from \$5 to \$15, most likely \$10.

However, I'd like to encourage Linux as a desktop and gaming platform. In my opinion, it's really good for it, despite
lacking native titles (admittedly, my gaming experience on Linux has been better than on Windows). For this reason,
I'd like to provide **free** binaries on the website, and possibly on [Launchpad], [Snap] and [AUR].

So far, many people interested in Samerion spend a lot of time on their phones and would prefer a mobile release. I'm
planning to release it for **free** on Android, as mobile experience is obviously poorer. It may also attract many new
players.

## Vanity items

Because a one-time payment made by a part of the player base might not be enough, I'd like to add vanity items/skins.

There will be one to three sets of skins released monthly. You can buy all of them at once, with a single payment.
You can also purchase skins released in the past at their original price, as long as they were released the same month
(for example, if it's December 2024, you can also purchase December 2023 skins).

However, if you're impatient and want to get a past set of skins and don't want to wait for the correct month, you can
pay a bit extra.

All of those items will be obtained by a premium currency, which can be bought for real money or earned over time
by playing. Prices may vary, I'm not sure what they will be.

### Annoying skins

Particles, visual effects etc. of skins will be possible to turn off in the game's settings as they tend to be annoying.

Speaking of this, vanity items themselves won't provide those — instead, there will be a separate slot, so you can mix
and match your visual effects to match any skin or armor piece. Be creative!

## Add-ons, unlockable areas

This is something I'd like to avoid, because I don't want to lock anything away from players, regardless if they paid
or not.

If necessary, however, I may release additional areas for the game that will be locked behind a pay wall, but only for
a limited time period. For example, if I release a fresh new area, you might need to pay to access it for the first
month, but after that time, it will be freely accessible for everyone.

Paid areas will not appear until late, since to at least the release of the game, I'll focus on the primary country
of the story — Sargonia.

## Subscription

For no-lifes, I'll offer a subscription, a rather cheap one, which will unlock access to all vanity skins — past,
current and future — as long as it's active. Additionally, it will instantly unlock access to said unlockable areas,
if they ever happen to be.

## Gaining advantage over other players by paying?

No.

Even if a locked zone — if those ever happen to be — has some unique new content, it won't be possible to be used outside
of the area in any competitive means.
