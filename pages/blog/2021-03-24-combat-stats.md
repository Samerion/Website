# Combat, pt. 2: stats and actions

This is a follow up to the last blog post. Here, I'll expand on character stats and in-combat actions.

* [Part 1](/blog/2021-03-16-combat)
* **Part 2**

## Statistics

Those have been almost entirely left the same since the beginning. Let's start from stats: values determining what
moves a character can do and how for long can they stand alive in the battle.

* **Health** (HP) — The more health a character has, the more hits they can take. If it drops to zero, you faint.
  A teammate could still save you, or maybe your opponent could have mercy.
* **Stamina** (SP) — Many of your actions, especially in combat, will use your stamina. You have to be careful to not
  tire yourself out too quickly, because it might turn out stamina is just as valuable as health. Again, if it drops to
  zero, you faint.
* **Mana** (MP) — And of course, if you want to use magic, you need mana. Unlike the previous two, mana is not
  necessary to keep you up and it quickly recharges, but you'll have much less of it than HP or SP.

During combat, most of most of your actions will use up either your stamina (attacks, skills) or mana (magic attacks,
spells). Managing those correctly is a crucial ability. It may also be helpful to use actions that exchange one for the
other to balance them out based on your current needs.

> New in Samerion: **short-term stamina** (STP) — Stamina used for movement. Works similar to mana, plus heavy use
> might also result in using up normal stamina.

## Actions

There are 4 types of combat actions available:

* **Attacks** — Using a weapon (or maybe even armor…?) to deal damage.
* **Skills** — Actions unlocked from class skill pool, you get new ones after leveling up. Those will always use
  stamina.
* **Spells** — Learned uses of magic, particularly for combat uses. Those will always use mana.
* **Movement** — Walking, running, escaping, anything in this area. Uses short-term stamina.

> New in Samerion: "Movement" previously only included the "flee" option, which used 3 stamina points. Combat
> in Samerion has been expanded to include area movement though — hide from your opponents, take cover, don't just
> stand in the open field!

Everyone (usually) has 6 skill (2 active, 2 passive and 2 universal) and 4 spell slots. A player can place an unlocked
spell or skill in a matching slot to use it in combat.

By the way, you can use any unlocked support skills and spells outside of combat. Yes, you can use magic to heal
yourself outside of battle. Spells aren't only for fighting!

### Skills

Skills are earned through leveling up. The mechanism is quite complex. It's also very experimental and might change at
any time.

In general, skills are grouped into classes — classes being warrior, ranger, mage and such. There is a huge pool
of skills you can unlock. Every time you level up, the game picks 4 semi-random locked skills from the pool and lets
you choose one to unlock.

This generally means classes aren't bound to character, but only to the skills one uses. This also means you can mix
classes as much as you'd like to, and even, the game will not always let you pick the exact route you'd want to. The
game will however be smart enough to give you skills that would match your current route and character.

Oh and also — there are primary and secondary classes. Unlocking secondary class skills may not be the easiest, as they
require you to first unlock and use primary class skills... An example of this build would be a warrior+mage subclass:
the paladin.

### Spells

To use a spell you need to have learned it first or have an item with instructions on using it — a scroll or a spell
book. Plus, your character needs to have fulfilled its requirements, of course. Learning a spell is just as simple as
using it a few times. Your intelligence stat (another topic for a blog) will speed up this process.

Spells can be used by any class and any character, although a specialized mage will definitely have it easier to learn
new and stronger ones.

Spells have elements, although those are primarily for area-control: you could spawn magic auras to boost certain
elements and weaken others, shield yourself from certain types of magic or setup elemental traps.

This is all for today. In the future I'd like to focus more classes and professions, moving away from combat.
I've been heavily reinforcing those in the last month, making both a lot more significant for the world than ever
before, so it might take some time before releasing posts on them. In the meantime you might get posts on the history
of the game's universe and learn some lore...
