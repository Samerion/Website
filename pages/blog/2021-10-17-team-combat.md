# Team combat, massive bosses and PvP

Been a while since the last blog post, huh? Sorry there, I didn't really have any ideas for stuff to blog about. It's
most likely going to be the same for the next month or so, sadly, but I hope I'll get to have some more time to write
the stuff.

It's been said over and over again: Samerion is an MMORPG. It's a multiplayer RPG. Ever since the first days of the
project's existence, multiplayer has been one of it's most important features. The combat system wasn't very developed,
so most of the fun in the game came out of co-op battles and exploring places together. Having a team really spices up
the experience, in my opinion.

## Singleplayer

Main story campaigns will be primarily singleplayer. Reach a target, do something. Those are mostly singleplayer tasks.
Along with it, there will be many areas, dungeons and bosses prepared specifically for singleplayer. Stuff you can
safely do alone.

Additionally, those campaigns will often send you NPC for your team to help you, so even in multiplayer areas, you'd
still have a chance.

However, as said, Samerion will be much more fun in a team.

## Team quests

Outside of main campaigns, the game will probably offer a couple of quests suitable for playing in a team. Now look, an
NPC offers you a quest. Who'll represent your team and talk with them to accept it? Would you discuss the prize?

Imagine this; normally when you approach an NPC, you just choose dialogue options to discuss whatever you got to
discuss. But this time, you have teammates, who are on the same quest, along with you. Those people can also join and
talk with the NPC along with you! Yes, Samerion will have multiplayer character dialogues. What's the fun of having
each of you talk to the NPC separately, after all?

## Team fights

Since we're in the topic of team quests, it should be obvious Samerion will let you fight opponents co-op with others.
Just invite someone to your team and every encounter to follow will have your friends on your side. This will be
instantaneous if you're close enough to each other, if you're not, your teammates will have 30 seconds to approach the
battlefield and join in.

Fights are turn based, and based on your character stats and other abilities, the game will shuffle turn order between
all characters, regardless of team.

Teams are limited to five people, so along with five of your fellows, you can go fight bandits, monsters or whatever
you'll encounter. Together, you can go on to explore the world, search through dungeons and go fights bosses as well.
As it has been mentioned in the post about [combat](/blog/2021-03-16-combat) all fights are going to be fast-paced,
so a whole round will usually last less than a half minute, even with a full team.

## Team bossfights

Now we're getting somewhere exciting. Bossfights. I already have a good couple ideas for really cool multiplayer-focused
bosses. Those will require you to cooperate to focus on multiple points on the battlefield. You will have to distract
the boss, attack its weak points... And defend yourself. It's not gonna be easy.

You'll have to use the battlefield to your advantage, take cover, use defensive and boosting magic spawns, and take
control over whatever the boss is going to do next.

All of those bosses really will require you to either bring a team or be greatly over-leveled. The second part isn't an
option once you reach the level cap though.

It's worth noting though... Samerion leaves a large space for adjusting your character, preparing some strategy. I've
recently been playing Deltarune (a really great game!) which itself is rather easy, but has some hidden bosses, which
are meant to be really difficult. Undertale — Deltarune predecessor, sort of — was famous for one of the secret bosses.
I think I'll hide Samerion's equivalent in multiplayer bosses. Shhh, there will definitely be no special prizes for
defeating multiplayer bosses alone! None at all!

## Player vs Player

Of course.

Samerion is meant to be mainly co-op, but PvP is still sort of a must. PvP battles won't be too different from PvE
battles in terms of mechanics. Assemble two teams of players, and feel free to start a battle against each other. If
both teams are willing.

## Double team attack!

OK, this is a very recent idea of mine. Definitely more complex.

But within the world of the game, even a team of 5 level-capped characters might not be enough to defeat the most
monstruous of enemies.

Some very special sort of bosses, for the most ambitious of players, will allow you to assemble two teams to fight co-op
against a dragon. Why two, and not a single 5 player team? Remember, combat is fast-paced. You don't want to wait
a minute or two for your comrades to finally decide what attack to use.

Both of the teams would fight simultaneously — one attacking the left, the other attacking the right side of the
opponent, and even while a person from team A is making their move, a person from team B can already do theirs.

Those teams will have to be kept in sync, so the opponent performs their attack when both of the teams finish their
round. You'll have to wait a bit, still, but much less anyway. I wonder what strategies you might come up with when
turns are slightly less out of order...?

That's it for today. Sadly for the next month or so I'll not be able to work on the game. Maybe just on some little
bits. I have to really focus on school this time around. But a bit of good news — after this period I'll be working
heavily on *combat*, which means you'll likely get a whole lot more news, and more people will be able to join the
ongoing `priv dev` testing phase.

Make sure to follow the news on Discord, or message me on Mastodon if you're coming from the Fediverse, for updates
regarding joining testing.

See you next time, adventurers!
